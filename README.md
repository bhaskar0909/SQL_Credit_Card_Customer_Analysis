Credit Card Customers Analysis 


## Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore the dataset and generate insights into the following areas:

Customer Attrition: Identify and analyze the factors influencing customer churn.

Customer Demographics: Understand customer age, gender, and marital status distributions.

Credit Card Usage: Analyze how customers are using their credit cards, including credit limits, transaction amounts, and card categories.

Inactive Customers: Investigate customer inactivity and spending trends.
## Analysis Areas

1.Table Structure
Count the number of records (rows) and columns in the Credit_card table.

2.Attrition Analysis
Analyze customer attrition and calculate the percentage of attrition based on:

Attrition flag

Gender

Marital status

Card category


3. Customer Demographics

Find the maximum and minimum customer age.
Analyze gender distribution of customers.

4. Credit Card Usage and Spending

Explore credit limits, card categories, transaction amounts, and inactivity months.

5. Inactive Customers

Measure inactivity in terms of months and transaction amounts.


## How To Use

1. Clone the Repository
Clone this repository to your local machine to access the SQL scripts.

2. Run the SQL Queries

    Run the provided SQL queries in your SQL client (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) connected to your Credit_card dataset to analyze customer data.

3. Review the Output

Analyze the output from each query to gather insights about customer behavior and trends.
## Technologies Used
SQL: Queries to analyze and extract data from the relational database.

Relational Database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL): The dataset is assumed to be in a relational database with the Credit_card table.
